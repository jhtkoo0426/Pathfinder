    <h1>About Pathfinder</h1>
    <p>Pathfinder is an interactive web application that visualises the path-finding process
        between railway stations on the London Railway Network.</p>

    <h3>Motivation</h3>
    <p>This project is an extension of one of my university courseworks (UCL COMP0005 Algorithms
        Module), which I built solely to demonstrate and test my skills in developing web
        applications, as well as applying algorithms I have learnt from the module.</p>
    <h3>Features</h3>
